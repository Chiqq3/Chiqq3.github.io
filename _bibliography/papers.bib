  abstract = {The burgeoning Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) spurs global technological advancements, notably in innovative community development through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. This study focuses on the high data rates and low latency offered by a millimeter-wave (mmWave) enabled vehicular network while addressing the significant challenge of link quality degradation due to blockages, exacerbated by the mmWave band’s small wavelength in high mobility and traffic conditions. We propose an RSU-assisted ITS system tailored for multi-lane, straight-road scenarios, effectively identifying blockage status for vehicles. Combining Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and MATLAB, this blockage-aware scheme lays the groundwork for future ITS enhancements. The research also delves into the effects of various frequency bands, vehicle types, and communication ranges, offering a holistic system performance analysis.},
