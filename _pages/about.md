**Chi Weiqi** received her B.E. degree in information engineering from **Tianjin University of Finance and Economics**, China, in 2020, and an M.E. degree in wireless communication engineering from **Tokyo Institute of Technology**, Japan, in 2022. She is currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in information engineering at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, **The University of Tokyo**, Japan. From February 2023 to December 2023, she worked as an Application Engineer at **General Test Systems Inc.**, specializing in Over-the-Air (OTA) testing solutions for connected vehicles. From November 2024 to January 2025, she was a Visiting Researcher at **Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt**, Germany, collaborating with the Artery core development team at the Car2X-Laboratory.

Her research interests include **millimeter-wave vehicular networks**, **machine learning for wireless communication**, **user association optimization**, V2X communication, intelligent transportation systems, and VANET simulation. Her current Ph.D. research focuses on **user association in mmWave V2X networks using machine learning solutions**, particularly developing **contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) algorithms** that address non-stationary reward problems in dynamic vehicular environments.

She is a project student of the <a href='https://www.cis-trans.jp/spring_gx/'><strong>JST SPRING GX program</strong></a> since April 2024 and was awarded the <strong>Young Researcher's Encouragement Award</strong> by the <a href='https://sites.ieee.org/vtc-tokyo/'><strong>IEEE VTS Tokyo/Japan Chapter</strong></a> in 2024. She was also a project student member of Tokyo Institute of Technology's <a href='https://www.sss.e.titech.ac.jp/en/'><strong>Super Smart Society (SSS) program</strong></a> from 2021 to 2022.
